## Hi there is Basya404👋

🤔 I’m interested in Game Development & Design. <br>
🌱 I’m currently learning Unity & C#. <br>
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on game development projects(GameJam), especially those using Unity and C#. <br> 
🤔 I’m looking for help with advanced Unity techniques, optimizing game performance, or integrating multiplayer features. <br>
💬 Ask me about game mechanics, Unity tips, or C# scripting. <br>
📫 How to reach me: nepbasya@gmail.com. <br>
😄 Pronouns: cowHorse. <br>
⚡ Fun fact: A "cowHorse" is actually a combination of a cow and a horse. <br>
